## üìä Project Overview

Vigil is a traffic accident detection system that uses computer vision and machine learning to analyze live traffic camera feeds. Our goal is to reduce emergency response times and potentially save lives by providing immediate accident detection and notification.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Real-time Video Processing**: Analyze multiple traffic camera feeds simultaneously
- **Image Classification and Object Detection**: Utilize an image classification model for accident deteaction and possibly object detection for accurate vehicle tracking
- **Scalable Data Pipeline**: Built with Apache Kafka and Apache Flink for high-throughput processing
- **Automated Alert System**: Instant notifications upon accident detection
