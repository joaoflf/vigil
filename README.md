# 🚨 Vigil

Real-Time Traffic Accident Detection System

</div>

## 📊 Project Overview

Vigil is a traffic accident detection system that uses computer vision and machine learning to analyze live traffic camera feeds. The core idea is to build a system that extract video frames from a large number of traffic cameras, runs it through a computer vision model that detects car accidents and then notify a user interface.
